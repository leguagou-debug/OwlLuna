              with Apple silicon, and it keeps and syncs your data the same way there. The Settings paths on this page,

                keeps a scrambled marker made from the token iPadOS gives the app for the signed-in iCloud account. The
                marker cannot be turned back into the account, tells one account from another and nothing more, and is
                never sent anywhere.

                <strong>Your notebooks.</strong> Handwriting (with the moment each stroke was made, which replay and
                the time-lapse use), typed text, pictures, scans, imported PDFs, audio recordings and their transcripts,
                flashcards and when you last reviewed them, tags, bookmarks, links, the page you left off on, and when
                you last locked, favourited, filed, tagged or deleted the notebook.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>The words read from your pages</strong> (handwriting, scans, PDFs, typed text and transcripts),
                so that search can find them.

              <li>
                <strong>Your settings</strong>, pens, folders, smart shelves and the stickers you made.

              <li>
                <strong>Your writing history.</strong> For each day, which pages you wrote on. It holds no text and no
                times of day. Settings › Writing History in the app turns it off or clears it.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some of this is handed to iPadOS, on the same iPad, so that system features work:</p>
            <ul className={styles.list} role="list">
              <li>
                <strong>Spotlight.</strong> Each notebook&rsquo;s title, cover and the words in it, so it can be found
                from the Home Screen. Settings › Search in the app turns this off and removes what was indexed. Locked
                notebooks are left out.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Widgets.</strong> The title, page number and cover of the notebook you last opened, and how
                many pages you wrote on recent days. When it writes this, the app does not name a locked notebook or
                show its cover; the page counts do include pages written in locked notebooks. A notebook made from a PDF
                or a scan has its first page as its cover.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Siri and Shortcuts.</strong> The names and page counts of your notebooks, so you can ask for
                one by name. Locked notebooks are not offered; a shortcut you made before locking a notebook keeps its
                name and still opens it, once you unlock it. When you ask Siri for a notebook aloud,{' '}
                <Out href={apple.features}>Apple handles that request</Out>, the name included, as it does any Siri

            </ul>
            <p>
              When something goes wrong, such as a file that cannot be read or a sync that fails, the app writes a line
              to the iPad&rsquo;s own system log. Those lines hold no note content and no notebook titles, and the app
              does not send them anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              The app adds no encryption of its own. Your files are protected the way iPadOS protects every
              app&rsquo;s files, which depends on your passcode. If you back up your iPad to iCloud or to a computer,
              iPadOS may include the app&rsquo;s files, as it does for any app.

              iCloud sync is the one way OwlLuna itself copies your notebooks off the iPad without you sending them
              somewhere yourself.

            <Stamp title="It asks first" className={styles.note}>
              <p>
                On a device that has never synced, OwlLuna copies nothing until you say yes. If the iPad is signed in
                to iCloud with iCloud Drive on, it asks once when it opens. Settings › iCloud in the app has the switch,
                and you can set it at any time, also before you sign in to iCloud. A device that was already syncing
                with an earlier version of OwlLuna carries on without being asked.
              </p>
            </Stamp>
            <h3 className={`display ${styles.sub}`}>What is copied</h3>
            <ul className={styles.list} role="list">
              <li>
                Every notebook, whole: everything listed under &ldquo;Your notebooks&rdquo; above, the words read from
                its pages, and its flashcards. Locked notebooks are copied like any other.
              </li>
              <li>Your folders and smart shelves, the pens in your tray, and the stickers you made.</li>
              <li>
                A small file holding a random ID that names this copy of your library. It lets a device tell when the
                copy was erased, or is another account&rsquo;s.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your writing history, your other settings and the search index are not copied.</p>
            <p>
              To tell what has changed since last time, each device also keeps a small record of what it last synced:
              the random IDs of its notebooks, with when each was last written in and last moved into or out of
              Recently Deleted, the IDs of its folders and smart shelves, the file names of its stickers, the ID of the iCloud copy, and
              the account marker described under <a href="#collected">What I collect</a>. That record stays on the
              device.
            </p>
            <h3 className={`display ${styles.sub}`}>Where it goes</h3>
            <p>
              Into the app&rsquo;s private container in your own iCloud storage, under your Apple Account. It is
              Apple&rsquo;s service: Apple moves the files between your devices, and I have no access to them. OwlLuna
              does not encrypt the copy itself; it is protected as the rest of your iCloud Drive is. Apple&rsquo;s
              handling of it is covered by <Out href={apple.privacy}>Apple&rsquo;s Privacy Policy</Out> and described in
              its <Out href={apple.icloud}>iCloud data security overview</Out>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sync runs only while OwlLuna is running. If you use the app on a Mac signed in to the same Apple Account,
              it syncs there too.
            </p>
            <p>
              OwlLuna syncs with the Apple Account the iPad is signed in to. If a different account signs in while
              sync is on, sync stops and asks before it copies your notebooks to that account&rsquo;s iCloud storage or
              brings anything in from it. A sync already under way at that moment stops after the notebook it is
              copying. If you say yes, the notebooks on the iPad are copied there and the notebooks that account holds
              are added; nothing is deleted. If you say no, sync is turned off on that device and stays off until you
              turn it on again in Settings › iCloud in the app, which asks again. Before you pass the iPad on to someone
              else, delete the app.
            </p>
            <h3 className={`display ${styles.sub}`}>Turning it off, and removing the copy</h3>
            <p>
              Settings › iCloud in the app has the switch, and each device has its own. Turning it off stops that
              device syncing. It does not remove what is already in iCloud.
            </p>
            <p>
              To remove the iCloud copy, first turn sync off on every device, because a device that still has it on will
              put the notebooks back. Then delete OwlLuna&rsquo;s data from your iCloud storage: iPadOS Settings › your
              name › iCloud lists the apps that keep data there (Apple renames those screens from time to time). If you
              turn sync on again afterwards, the device sees that the copy is gone and uploads its notebooks, folders
              and stickers again. Nothing is removed from the device.
            </p>
            <h3 className={`display ${styles.sub}`}>When you delete a notebook</h3>
            <p>
              A notebook you delete for good is removed from iCloud the next time that device syncs, and from your other
              devices after that. A delete only applies to the version of the notebook that device had. If another
              device has written in the notebook since, or has taken it back out of Recently Deleted, the notebook is
              kept and comes back to the device that deleted it. That holds whether or not the other device&rsquo;s
              change had reached the deleting device: a device that finds it holds a newer version than the one that
              was deleted keeps it and sends it to iCloud again. The same check is made for Recently Deleted: a
              notebook put there on one device and written in on another that had not heard of it comes back out. For a
              notebook that is removed, a small marker named with its random ID stays in the container so the other
              devices know which version was deleted. It holds two dates and nothing else: when that notebook was last
              written in, and when it was last moved into or out of Recently Deleted.

                You choose pictures in Apple&rsquo;s photo picker, and the app receives only those. It never looks

                such as where it was taken. If you save an exported picture or video to Photos from the share sheet,

                Only when you ask for a transcript of a recording. It is done on the iPad: the app requires on-device

                and the subject of a photo is cut out for a sticker, by Apple&rsquo;s Vision framework on the iPad.

                <strong>Translation.</strong> Only when you choose Translate for handwriting you have turned into text.
                The app hands those lines to the translator built into iPadOS. Apple describes it as working on the
                device, once iPadOS has downloaded the language from Apple.

                <strong>Study guides.</strong> Only when you open Study Guide. The words already read from your pages,
                or a recording&rsquo;s transcript, are given to Apple&rsquo;s on-device language model, the one behind
                Apple Intelligence, through Apple&rsquo;s framework. OwlLuna has no other model and no server of its own,
                so on an iPad without Apple Intelligence there is no study guide.

                <strong>Typing.</strong> Typed text goes through the ordinary iPadOS keyboard and text tools, such as
                dictation, autocorrection, or another keyboard you have installed. Those belong to iPadOS or to the
                keyboard&rsquo;s maker and work as they do in any app.

              Apart from <a href="#icloud">iCloud sync</a>, nothing leaves the app unless you do one of these:

            <ul className={styles.list} role="list">
              <li>
                <strong>Export or print.</strong> A notebook as a PDF, pages as images, or a page as a time-lapse video
                is handed to the iPadOS share sheet or print panel. The file is named after the notebook, and a PDF
                carries its title, bookmarks and links. Covering something with ink or study tape does not take it out
                of an exported PDF: what lies underneath is still in the file.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Back up.</strong> Settings › Backup makes one file of your whole library and hands it to the
                share sheet. The file is not encrypted, and it contains every notebook, including locked ones and any
                still in Recently Deleted, along with your writing history. If any notebook is locked, making a backup,
                or sharing the last one again, asks for Face ID, Touch ID or the passcode first. Keep the file somewhere
                you trust.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Copy or drag.</strong> Text you copy goes to the iPadOS clipboard, and a picture you drop on a
                page comes in from another app.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Present.</strong> While you present, the page is shown on the second screen you connected.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Open a link.</strong> A web link you placed on a page opens in your browser, and Settings ›

            </ul>
            <p>Where a file goes after the share sheet is up to the app or service you chose there.</p>
          </Part>

          <Part id="locks">
            <p>
              A lock keeps a notebook closed in the app. It asks for Face ID, Touch ID or the passcode each time the
              notebook is opened, blurs its cover, and leaves what is written in it out of search, Spotlight, the widgets
              and On This Day.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is not encryption. A locked notebook&rsquo;s files are stored like any other notebook&rsquo;s, and its
              iCloud copy and any backup file hold it in full. Its title is still shown in the library. It is not
              offered to Siri and Shortcuts, and making a backup asks you to unlock first.
            </p>
            <p>
              With iCloud sync on, a lock reaches each of your other devices the next time that device syncs, whether
              or not the notebook has been written in since, and it is then taken out of that device&rsquo;s Spotlight
              and widgets. Until a device has synced, it still opens the notebook without asking. Newer pages arriving
              from a device that had not yet received the lock do not remove it, and if a notebook changed on two
              devices is kept as a conflicted copy, the copy is locked as well.

                Deleting it moves it to Recently Deleted. It is removed for good after 30 days, the next time the app
                opens, or sooner if you delete it from there yourself. With iCloud sync on, the app syncs first when it
                can, so a notebook you restored on another device is not removed. If that restore has not reached this
                iPad by then, the notebook is removed here, stays on the device that restored it, and comes back here

              If you have agreed to share analytics with app developers (iPadOS Settings › Privacy &amp; Security ›
              Analytics &amp; Improvements), Apple may send me crash reports and usage figures for the app, and the App
              Store shows me totals such as how many times it was downloaded. Apple says these do not identify you.
              They come from iPadOS and the App Store, not from any code in OwlLuna, and you can switch the sharing off
              in the same place.

              The beta comes through TestFlight, which is Apple&rsquo;s service, not code in OwlLuna. While you test,
              Apple collects the following and passes it to me. You cannot opt out of it.
            </p>
            <ul className={styles.list} role="list">
              <li>
                <strong>Crash reports.</strong> When the app crashes, the crash log, which shows where in OwlLuna&rsquo;s
                code it happened and how long the app had been running.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Usage and your iPad.</strong> How many times you installed and used each build, how many times
                it crashed, which version you have, your iPad&rsquo;s model and an identifier for it, and its iPadOS
                version and language.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Feedback is up to you. If you send it from the TestFlight app, by taking a screenshot in OwlLuna, or when
              TestFlight asks after a crash, I also get your comments and any screenshot. With them come the
              iPad&rsquo;s battery level, free storage, screen resolution, time zone, processor type, connection type
              and mobile carrier, and how long the app had been open. A screenshot shows whatever is on the screen, your
              notes included, and you can send feedback without one.

              Apple lets me use all of this only to improve the app, and not share it with anyone else. Apple keeps
