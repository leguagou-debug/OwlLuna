                <p>
                  When I was a student, there were only a handful of really good apps for taking notes by hand on an
                  iPad. Every one of them wanted money: a subscription, or a one-time fee if you were lucky. I used to
                  wonder whether a free app could ever be as good as the paid ones.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.noted}>
                  Then I graduated, and started working, and the question came with me. It sat in the back of my head
                  like a to-do I never ticked.
                  <TickBox ticked={false} className={`${styles.doodle} ${styles.doodleLast}`} />
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because look at the sums. First you buy the iPad. Then you buy the Pencil, which is a pencil that
                  needs charging. And then, once you own both, an app asks for a monthly fee before you may write on
                  the glass you have already paid for. Paper has its faults, but it has never once sent me a renewal
                  notice.
                </p>
                <p>So I built the app myself, from scratch. The idea was simple enough to fit on an index card:</p>

                <div className={styles.slot}>
                  <Tape color="sage" className={styles.slotTape} />
                  <IndexCard side={' '} className={styles.card}>
                    <ol role="list" className={styles.principles}>
                      <li>
                        <span className={styles.numeral} aria-hidden="true">1.</span>
                        <span>
                          <strong>Free.</strong> No subscription, no one-time fee, nothing to unlock.
                        </span>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <span className={styles.numeral} aria-hidden="true">2.</span>
                        <span>
                          <strong>Open source.</strong> Every line is on GitHub, so you don&rsquo;t have to take my
                          word for it.
                        </span>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <span className={styles.numeral} aria-hidden="true">3.</span>
                        <span>
                          <strong>No data collection.</strong> Your notes are yours. I never see them, and frankly I
                          have enough of my own handwriting to decipher.
                        </span>
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                  </IndexCard>
                </div>

                <p className={styles.noted}>
                  <TickBox className={`${styles.doodle} ${styles.doodleFirst}`} delay={0.2} />
                  &ldquo;Simple&rdquo; turned out to take a while. But here it is: the app I was looking for back then.
                  I hope it is the one you were looking for too.
