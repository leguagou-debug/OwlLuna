# Contributing to OwlLuna

Thanks for helping. Everyone taking part follows the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Workflow

1. For anything bigger than a small fix, open an issue first so we can agree on the approach.
2. Fork the repo and branch from `main`.
3. Keep each pull request to one change.
4. The app should build without warnings and the tests should pass (⌘U).
5. For UI changes, add iPad screenshots or a short recording in portrait and landscape, light and dark.

## Code style

- Swift and SwiftUI, with UIKit where PencilKit needs it (`Canvas/`).
- Match the code around you: small types, clear names, few comments. Add a short comment only when the reason isn't obvious.
- The project uses folder-synchronised groups, so a new file only needs to go in the right folder.
- Page geometry lives in `PageStackLayout`; cover changes to it with unit tests.
- No third-party dependencies without an issue first. The app uses Apple frameworks only.

## Privacy

OwlLuna collects no data. Don't add analytics, tracking, ads, or network calls that send user content anywhere.

## Reporting bugs

Use the bug report form in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/owaisazmal/OwlLuna/issues/new/choose). Include your iPad model, iPadOS version, the app's version and build, the steps, and what you expected. For drawing bugs, say whether you used Apple Pencil or a finger.

Issues are public. Report security problems, or privacy questions about your own notes, privately: see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
